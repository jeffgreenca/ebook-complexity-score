# ebook-complexity-score

# installation

```
git clone https://github.com/jeffgreenca/ebook-complexity-score.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# usage
1. make sure your books are in epub format and end with .epub
1. folder structure must be as shown:
```
group1\
  book-folder-a\
    book-a.epub
  book-folder-b\
    book-b.epub
group2\
  book-folder-x\
    book-x.epub
```
1. edit `targets.txt` to contain a list of top-level folders to scan, one per
line. In this case it would be the full path to `group1` and `group2`.

1. run:
```
python ebook-analysis.py
```

# example output

As you can see from the output, this approach may have some data issues (i.g., State of the Art).
Possible improvements would be to attempt to select length-normalized chunks of
sentences from each book and run the algorithms on these chunks, rather than a
full-text scan of the extracted content.
